Flyweight Pattern

//////

This pattern is called flyweight because instead of having 
to work with many massive, individual objects, you whittle
them down to a smaller set of more generic objects, called 
flyweights, that can be configured at runtime to look like the 
more plentiful, massive objects. Each massive object consumes
system resources; by extracting what's generic from those 
massive objects and relying on runtime configuration to mimiv those 
massive objects, you save those resources.
