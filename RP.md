RP - event driven
RSys - message driven

RP is related to dataflow programming since emphasis is on flow of data
rather than flow of control

Abstractions:
* Futures/Promises
* Streams
* Dataflow Variables (like spreadsheet cells)

messages have clear (single) destination, while events are facts
for others to observe

Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability 
that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses 
to that item will return the last updated value
