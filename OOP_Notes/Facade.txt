Facade Pattern

//////

Facade pattern gives you a wrapper that makes the
original code easier to deal with.

//////

The GoF book says: "The Facade pattern should provide
a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a system.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the
subsystem easier to use."
